# YoshinoBot

Once upon a time I started developing this Discord bot as a replacement for all others (that is, I wanted to have my database, my functions, etc.). But because of the soon-to-be-unnecessary, I gave it up.

# Warning!

I warn you that if you want to download this repository, you will see a lot of commented-out lines in the code. These are removed functions from the bot, which I either did not need, or interfered with the main process.

# Install

For the bot to work correctly, you need to install the following modules (the bot is written in Node JS, so you need to install modules via npm (how to do this I will not tell you, Google it yourself)):
1. discord.js
2. fs
3. ms
4. ytdl-core (That's possible)
5. moment


Also, if you want to fully install the library, you need some more json files:
1. profile
2. clan
3. botconfig
4. desc
